# Recent Deep Learning papers in NLU and RL

I think that other people's notes are rarely useful, so I'm listing the interesting for me papers with a few words about the main idea for me to make references in memory.

If you're in such stuff, welcome: [__papers list__](./PAPERS2019.md).

To keep list size feasible the each year papers are separated to specific file:
* [2019](./PAPERS2019.md)
* [2018](./PAPERS2018.md)
* [2017](./PAPERS2017.md)
* [2016 & earlier](./PAPERS.md)

I'm not only adding recent papers, but also update lists for previous periods, if I find interesting "old" paper. To keep up with updates, you could follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/madrugad0).

Also I've found that, there are some additional materials which are helpful for me or my students, so I've added a new list of miscellaneous [articles](./MISC.md). It is not sorted in chronological order, only by content type.

To make the tool work you need Table-of-Content creation tool, which is integrated with this software; you only need `wget` available for download. This tool has an option of twitter integration, which need to be installed and configured before usage. The tool was tested to work on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 & MacOS X 10.6; it should work on newer versions of these operating systems.

## Table of Contents
I'm using [toc maker](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc.go) from Eugeny Kalinin, it is very useful, thank to him for this tool.

## Twitter integration
For twitting I'm using the perfect ["t"](https://github.com/sferik/t). It is really elegant and simple to use.
