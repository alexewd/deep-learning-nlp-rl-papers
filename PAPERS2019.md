### Pull out all the stops: Textual analysis via punctuation sequences

**Authors:** Alexandra N. M. Darmon, Marya Bazzi, Sam D. Howison, Mason A. Porter

**Abstract:** Whether enjoying the lucid prose of a favorite author or slogging through some other writer's cumbersome, heavy-set prattle (full of parentheses, em-dashes, compound adjectives, and Oxford commas), readers will notice stylistic signatures not only in word choice and grammar, but also in punctuation itself. Indeed, visual sequences of punctuation from different authors produce marvelously different (and visually striking) sequences. Punctuation is a largely overlooked stylistic feature in "stylometry'', the quantitative analysis of written text. In this paper, we examine punctuation sequences in a corpus of literary documents and ask the following questions: Are the properties of such sequences a distinctive feature of different authors? Is it possible to distinguish literary genres based on their punctuation sequences? Do the punctuation styles of authors evolve over time? Are we on to something interesting in trying to do stylometry without words, or are we full of sound and fury (signifying nothing)?

**Notes:** really nice idea - analyze the punctuation itself, it is shown to be enough to distinct authorship; I think that some other tasks could be formulated, like punctuation style transfer or punctuation improvement only just from big corpora

### Assessing BERT’s Syntactic Abilities

**Authors:** Yoav Goldberg

**Abstract:** I assess the extent to which the recently introduced BERT model captures English syntactic phenomena, using (1) naturally-occurring subject-verb agreement stimuli; (2) “coloreless green ideas” subject-verb agreement stimuli, in which content words in natural sentences are randomly replaced with words sharing the same part-of-speech and inflection; and (3) manually crafted stimuli for subject-verb agreement and reflexive anaphora phenomena. The BERT model performs remarkably well on all cases.

**Notes:** I like the idea of this small and concise research, it answers clear question clearly; I think more research could be done in this direction
